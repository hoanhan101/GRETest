# GRE Learning Application

This project was also accomplished at Techkids.vn. Along with PokemonQuiz, we made this GRE flashcards learning app because we wanted to study UITableView in Swift and build something more attractive than Quizlet.

The philosophy behind the app:
* It had to be simple, friendly colorful and easy to use.
* It had the learning process: Green line for Mastered Word (Right on first try), Yellow for Reviewing (Right on the second try), Red for Learning (Every wrong).
